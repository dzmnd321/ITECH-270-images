            <h3>Maui</h3>
            <p>I went to Hawaii and visited Maui, the second biggest island of the state. One of my favorite activities was the whale watching tours. It was incredible to see the humpback whales in their natural habitat. I was also able to pick and eat my own pineapple from the Maui pineapple farm, it was the freshest pineapple I've ever tried.</p>

            <h3>Tokyo</h3>
            <p>I would say Tokyo was my favorite place to go to. I really enjoyed going to Club Sega, it's this massive arcade in Tokyo that has over 200 games. I spent the whole day playing Tekken and Street Fighter. I also got to eat some of the freshest sushi I've ever had, it was from this small shop that was owned by the same family for nearly 100 years.</p>

            <h3>Iceland</h3>
            <p>I traveled to Iceland and visited the Dettifoss, one of the 10,000 waterfalls on the island. I also took a tour to the  Geothermal plant. I learned quite a bit about the enviormental efforts that the Icelandic government has been doing. Apparently they are leading in Geothermal energy, which I thought was super interesting. </p>

            <h3>Paris, France</h3>
            <p>I always had an interest in the Paris catacombs and this summer I was finally able to take a visit and explore the tunnels. I learned so much of the history of why they were built. I really liked some of the food I found around the city, never thought I'd eat a whole loaf of bread but when in Paris, I guess. </p>
